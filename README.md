# unity-visuals

Experimenting with using Unity to render visuals. The idea is to generate the geometry (e.g. billboarded quads and voxels) on the GPU so it's efficient.

Done in Unity because it can build UWP apps for HoloLens devices. I will probably take this code and apply it in a HoloLens project somewhere else.
